Personal Website
This is a dynamic single page web application(yet to be hosted) built using pure JS, HTML and CSS. It consists of 4 files. The .html, .css, .json and 
the images used.
Each view of this SPA gives information about me, experience, hobbies and projects I did.
In order to veiw the website, host it in a local server. If you try to open the html file without hosting it in the local server it doesnot
read the contents from .json as you cannot point your browser directly at file://some/path/some.html.
I have attached a video of how website looks and how to host it on local host.
Thanks :)
